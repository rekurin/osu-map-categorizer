Goals:
Catagorize osu! maps into types: Aim, Alt, Burst, Stream, Consistency, Tech, Slider, Streams, Gimmick (?)
Training Dataset: found from osu!Collector -> Fetch map #'s from different catagories labeled with one type, Trains based on map placement points of hitobjects (long text string)
At the end, will associate a percentage of each catagory a certain map falls into. (eg. 20% tech, 10% consistency, 70% aim)
